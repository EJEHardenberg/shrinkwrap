tiny little web tool that helps you with task t-shirt sizing (aka effort estimation, aka assigning story points) for a scrum planning meeting. 

currently it only uses html5 local storage to save things, but if you wait a little, it will have a node server and websockets, so that all team members can do this remotely.
